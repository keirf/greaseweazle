************************************

** v0.12 - 10 March 2020
 - GW Autodetect: General improvements, and now works on Windows 7
 - New read parameter --double-step to double-step drive heads
   - Useful for reading a 40-cylinder disk in an 80-cylinder drive
 - New 'pin' command allows a floppy pin to be set to specified level
   - Currently supported only for pin 2 (DENSEL)
 - New 'reset' command resets the Greaseweazle to power-on settings
   - Motors off, drives deselected, power-on pin levels and delay values

** v0.11 - 21 January 2020
 - GW.py: Auto-detect the COM/serial port device name
   - The device argument is now optional!
 - USB: Provide a serial-id string to the host
   - Identifier is unique to each Greaseweazle device
   - Allows disambiguation between multiple Greaseweazle devices
   - Recommended: Full flash from HEX file (embeds serial in bootloader)
 - Ubuntu: Udev script now creates a /dev/greaseweazle symlink

** v0.10 - 17 January 2020
 - STM32F7xx: Multi-drive support via drive-select config option
   - Up to three Shugart drives or two IBM/PC drives
   - gw.py read|write --drive {a,b,0,1,2}
   - See the "Drive Select" wiki page

** v0.9 - 7 January 2020
 - Activity LED
   - Lights while a USB-issued command is in progress
   - Flashes when enumerated but idle in the firmware-update bootloader

** v0.8 - 6 January 2020
 - STM32F73xx: Various Fixes and Improvements
   - Allow Firmware Update mode to be forced via strapping Serial RX/TX
   - Fix bogus sample values at start of read flux values
   - Fix some time constants to be in units of the sample clock
 - USB: Advertise USB 2.0 device descriptor

** v0.7 - 6 December 2019
 - USB: Fix end-of-stream detection on track writes
   - Writes of empty/unformatted tracks sometimes hung forever
 - No Flux Area: Firmware automatically masters long NFAs during track writes
   - Generating no flux transitions does not read back as a NFA
 - STM32F73xx: Initial support for new STM32 MCU
   - Two HEX files are included: Use Greaseweazle-F1-* for existing boards!
   - Single unified UPD file containing both firmware images

** v0.6 - 15 November 2019
 - gw.py: Big overhaul of underlying Python package
   - Action (read, write, update) must come first on the command line
   - eg. "python3 gw.py read --ecyl=39 foo.scp COM3"
 - gw.py: New action "delays" to print/set delay parameters
   - eg. "python3 gw.py delays --step=10000" to increase step time to 10ms

** v0.5 - 11 November 2019
 - USB: Overhaul the protocol and allow writes to be terminated at index
   - Terminate-at-index is always used by current Python control script
   - Terminate-at-index prevents an over-long write from overwriting itself
   - Fix interruption of track writes (eg. KeyboardInterrupt)
 - gw.py: New option --adjust-speed to normalise flux times for target drive
   - Measures RPM of the target drive and calculates an adjustment factor

** v0.4 - 5 November 2019
 - Blinky: Diagnostic test firmware to detect fake STM32 chips
   - https://github.com/keirf/Greaseweazle/wiki/STM32-Fakes
 - Floppy Write: Fix for very short flux timings
 - Floppy Read: Fix for very long flux timings
 - USB: Small improvement to double-buffer logic

** v0.3 - 30 October 2019
 - Bootloader: Fix Programming-Jumper detection
 - Read Track: Various minor fixes
 - SCP: Fix the SCP file headers generated by "gw.py read"
 ** IMPORTANT USER INSTRUCTIONS **:
 - Users must serial-update using the v0.3 HEX file
   - DO NOT update from v0.2 using the UPD file
 - May need to install the crcmod package: eg "pip3 install crcmod"

** v0.2 - 29 October 2019
 - USB: Fix hangs during "gw.py read"
   - Thanks to Charlie Smurthwaite for telling me how to fix this!
 - USB: Improved bandwidth (double-buffered IN/OUT endpoints)
   - Reduces risk of buffer underflow/overflow during disk operations
 - Firmware Update: Requires a jumper across A14 (aka DCL) and GND
   - eg. "python gw.py update Greaseweazle-v0.2.upd COM3"

** v0.1 - 17 October 2019
 - First release
